Predicting Probability of Default of a Potential Borrower

# Project Summary
This project will predict whether a borrower will default a loan or not based on his/her income, credit history, age, Loan Amount etc. This projecy will help the Financial firms, to process the borrower's information before making a decision. This project will apply machine learning and business rules to reduce risk and ensure profitability of financial firms.

Let's take an example of 2 applicants who had applied for a loan of 1000$ each. Bank process both application manually.

Applicant A :- Ideally his application should be rejectd based on his financial condistion, But bank approves his loan and released 1000 dollars loan to him. Later that applicant did not repaid the loan and got defaulted. In this case the total amount of loss of bank is *1000$*. 

Applicant B :- Ideally his application should be approved based on his good financial condition, But bank rejects his loan. In this case bank has lost the interest amount ex. 70$, which it had earned.

The bank will be in more debt, if they approves a defaulters loan rather then rejecting a non-defaulters loan. In other words giving a loan to a bad customer marked as a good customer results in a greater cost to the bank than denying a loan to a good customer marked as a bad customer.

In this project, we are developing a automated process, which will approve/reject all Loan applications, based on different factors. It will save a lot of time of the bank which was spent on manual process and help them to reduce the human errors and save Banks money by reducing the loan to defaulters.

## Probability of Default (POD)
The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD, is the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan obligations. For individual borrowers, POD is based on a combination of two factors, i.e., credit score and debt-to-income ratio.

The POD for corporate borrowers is obtained from credit rating agencies. If the lender determines that a potential borrower demonstrates a lower probability of default, the loan will come with a low interest rate and low or no down payment on the loan. The risk is partly managed by pledging collateral against the loan.

## Loss Given Default (LGD)
Loss given default (LGD) refers to the amount of loss that a lender will suffer in case a borrower defaults on the loan. For example, assume that two borrowers, A and B, with the same debt-to-income ratio and an identical credit score. Borrower A takes a loan of $10,000 while B takes a loan of $200,000.

The two borrowers present with different credit profiles, and the lender stands to suffer a greater loss when Borrower B defaults since the latter owes a larger amount. Although there is no standard practice of calculating LGD, lenders consider an entire portfolio of loans to determine the total exposure to loss.
