Predicting Probability of Default of a Potential Borrower

## Probability of Default (POD)
The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD, is the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan obligations. For individual borrowers, POD is based on a combination of two factors, i.e., credit score and debt-to-income ratio.

The POD for corporate borrowers is obtained from credit rating agencies. If the lender determines that a potential borrower demonstrates a lower probability of default, the loan will come with a low interest rate and low or no down payment on the loan. The risk is partly managed by pledging collateral against the loan.

## Loss Given Default (LGD)
Loss given default (LGD) refers to the amount of loss that a lender will suffer in case a borrower defaults on the loan. For example, assume that two borrowers, A and B, with the same debt-to-income ratio and an identical credit score. Borrower A takes a loan of $10,000 while B takes a loan of $200,000.

The two borrowers present with different credit profiles, and the lender stands to suffer a greater loss when Borrower B defaults since the latter owes a larger amount. Although there is no standard practice of calculating LGD, lenders consider an entire portfolio of loans to determine the total exposure to loss.
