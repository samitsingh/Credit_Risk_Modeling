Predicting Probability of Default of a Potential Borrower

## Probability of Default (POD)
The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD, is the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan obligations. For individual borrowers, POD is based on a combination of two factors, i.e., credit score and debt-to-income ratio.

The POD for corporate borrowers is obtained from credit rating agencies. If the lender determines that a potential borrower demonstrates a lower probability of default, the loan will come with a low interest rate and low or no down payment on the loan. The risk is partly managed by pledging collateral against the loan.
